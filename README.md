# Influenza-Season
Predictive analysis on influenza trends to advise of medical staffing needs for the upcoming influenza season.
# Key Questions
    ● Who is affected by influenza? 

    ● When is flu season?

    ● Where are influenza death rates the highest?

    ● What are the top 5 states with the most flu deaths?  
    
    ● Is there a significant difference in the deaths of the vulnerable population compared to the rest of the population? 
    
# Tools Used in the Project
1. Excel
2. Tableau for Dashboard and Story
3. Word for Interim Report

# Data
"Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender"  Dataset provided by CareerFoundry from the CDC. 

"Population data by geogrphy" Dataset provided by CareerFoundry from the US Census Bureau. 

# Limitations
Main dataset from 2017, and is considered outdated due to how quickly population rates change.

Data is prone to errors due to manual entry; however, data is still assumed to be reliable. 

There could be sampling bias because according to the CDC, “Deaths of nonresidents (e.g. nonresident aliens, nationals living abroad, residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and other territories of the U.S.) and fetal deaths are excluded in the death rate.’ This could lead to biased data as it does not account for all deaths in the United States, only deaths of the residents and those post birth. 

# Findings: 
  #### Who is affected by the flu? 
Everyone!  However, the vulnerable population suffers the most. There a significant difference in the deaths of the vulnerable population compared to the rest of the population? 
  
#### Where are flu rates the highest?
California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Florida
 
#### When is flu season
Flu season lasts all year but peaks in the months October - April. 

# Recommendations: 
- Focus on states with the highest vulnerable population as they will require the most staffing.  This includes Californai, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Florida.  Additional staffing will be needed October - April.
